# Open Manipulator X Control in Gazebo

This ROS package allows you to control the Open Manipulator X in the Gazebo simulation environment. Follow the steps below to set up and run the package on Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS1.

## Steps to Control Open Manipulator X in Gazebo

### 1. Installation of Open Manipulator X

The Open Manipulator X package was installed following the instructions provided in the official e-manual. You can access the manual here(https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/overview/). This manual provides detailed installation instructions for setting up the manipulator.

### 2. Launching the Controller File

To run the Open Manipulator in the Gazebo simulation environment, launch the controller file with the parameter `use_platform=false`.

### 3. Launching Gazebo

Start the Gazebo simulation by launching it and pressing the play button in the Gazebo interface to begin the simulation.

### 4. Creating a ROS Package

A new ROS package named `manipulator_x_control` was created. In this package:

- A `scripts` folder was added.
- A Python script named `final.py` was developed to control the Open Manipulator X in the Gazebo simulation.

The `final.py` script implements a Python-based control system using ROS services. Its main purpose is to move the robot's joints and control its gripper through a sequence of specified joint positions. The script communicates with ROS services to achieve precise control over the manipulator's joints and gripper.

### 5. Running the Script

Execute the `final.py` script to control the Open Manipulator X in the Gazebo environment.

### 6. Run this code in Hardware:
Connect your robot.
launch conntroller.
Run script.

## Video

A video demonstrating the real-time simulation of the robot is included in the package folder.
